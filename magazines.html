Companies that prioritize ESG issues are better equipped to address emerging challenges related to sustainability and social responsibility and are more likely to achieve long-term success. However, ESG practices can vary widely across companies and industries, and it can be difficult to assess the level of maturity of a company's ESG practices.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eESG maturity refers to the level of development and implementation of ESG practices within a company or organization. The concept of maturity suggests that ESG practices evolve and improve over time, starting from a basic level and progressing towards a more advanced level of implementation. Assessing ESG maturity involves evaluating the company's policies, practices, and reporting related to ESG issues. This can include factors such as the use of renewable energy, diversity and inclusion policies, supply chain management, and transparency in reporting.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo help companies assess and improve their ESG maturity, several organizations have developed frameworks and standards such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) which provides a framework for assessing ESG maturity through its Sustainability Reporting Standards, which cover a range of ESG topics and provide guidance on how companies can report on their ESG performance in a transparent and meaningful way. The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) also provides a set of industry-specific standards that help companies identify and disclose the ESG issues that are most material to their business and stakeholders.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eESG maturity can be illustrated through examples of companies that have made significant progress in improving their ESG practices. Unilever is one such company that has set ambitious goals to reduce its environmental footprint, increase the diversity of its workforce, and promote sustainable sourcing practices. Unilever has also integrated ESG considerations into its business strategy and decision-making processes, and regularly reports on its progress toward its ESG goals. Another example is Microsoft, which has taken a holistic approach to ESG by integrating sustainability considerations into its operations, supply chain, and product development. The company has set targets to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2030, improve the energy efficiency of its data centers, and increase the use of renewable energy. Microsoft has also developed tools and services to help customers track and reduce their carbon footprint.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn conclusion, ESG maturity is a critical concept that helps companies identify areas for improvement and develop a roadmap for advancing their ESG practices. By prioritizing ESG considerations, companies can improve their financial performance, manage risks, and enhance their reputation with stakeholders. The frameworks and standards developed by organizations such as the GRI and SASB can provide guidance and support for companies seeking to improve their ESG maturity. Ultimately, a company's ESG maturity is an important indicator of its commitment to sustainability and social responsibility and can contribute to long-term success in a rapidly changing business landscape.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://investor.monetix.io/investor-signup?ref=monetix-lending.ghost.io\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\"\u003eStart Impact Investing Today\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/2023/04/MONETIX-IG--38-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1080\" height=\"1080\" srcset=\"https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/04/MONETIX-IG--38-.png 600w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/04/MONETIX-IG--38-.png 1000w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/2023/04/MONETIX-IG--38-.png 1080w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/2023/04/The-Author--1-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" srcset=\"https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/04/The-Author--1-.png 600w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/04/The-Author--1-.png 1000w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2023/04/The-Author--1-.png 1600w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/2023/04/The-Author--1-.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e",

We observed that a significant number of small, everyday businesses were predominantly operated by women. However, they often faced a lack of funding and capital to propel their ventures to the next level. By prioritizing investments in these women-led businesses, we aim to bridge this gap and provide them with the necessary support to unlock their full potential.

The story highlights deforestation, greenhouse gases, plastic pollution, corporate greed, and the need for collective action.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 1971, Dr. Seuss wrote a timeless tale, \"The Lorax,\" emphasizing environmental stewardship and the consequences of exploitation. Through vivid illustrations and storytelling, the book teaches valuable lessons on saving our environment. As we face growing environmental challenges, the wisdom of the Lorax is more relevant than ever. Let's explore the vital lessons and make a difference in preserving our planet.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\"The Lorax\" tells the story of the Once-ler, driven by greed, who destroys the Truffula forest despite the Lorax's warning. This reflects today's resource exploitation, urging sustainable practices and responsible consumption.

The Once-ler's relentless chopping down of Truffula trees leads to the displacement of the Brown Bar-ba-loots, Swomee-Swans, and Humming-Fish. This narrative parallels the real-world impact of deforestation on biodiversity and habitat loss, underscoring the importance of preserving our forests and protecting the ecosystems they support.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGreenhouse Gases and Climate Change:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe book hints at the environmental impact of the Once-ler's actions, as depicted by the spreading smog and polluted air. While not explicitly mentioned, this symbolizes the release of greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. \"The Lorax\" reminds us of the urgent need to address our carbon footprint and transition to sustainable energy sources to mitigate the effects of climate change.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlastic Pollution and Environmental Degradation:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn \"The controversial children’s Book,\" the theme of environmental degradation encompasses the issue of plastic pollution and Industrial waste in the water bodies. Plastic pollution poses a significant threat to biodiversity. Wildlife becomes entangled in plastic debris, marine creatures mistake it for food, and ecosystems suffer from contamination. World Environment Day emphasizes the urgent need to beat plastic pollution to protect the diverse array of species that rely on healthy ecosystems. Let us focus on beating plastic pollution serves as a call to action to reduce single-use plastics, promote recycling, and develop eco-friendly alternatives.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/2023/06/Lorax-water-in-the-pond-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1144\" height=\"498\" srcset=\"https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/06/Lorax-water-in-the-pond-1.png 600w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/06/Lorax-water-in-the-pond-1.png 1000w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/2023/06/Lorax-water-in-the-pond-1.png 1144w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCorporate Greed and Excessive Consumption:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Once-ler's insatiable greed and pursuit of profit mirror the destructive impact of corporate greed and excessive consumerism on the environment.

                  "html": "\u003cp\u003eLast month, we had a conversation with Alexander Mann, who is the founder of Smart Grow Agritech LLC and also serves as the director of Proof of ESG. During the discussion, he introduced us to his industrial hemp project and spoke passionately about the use of industrial hemp in ESG and sustainability initiatives. We invite you to join us as we learn more about this incredible plant and why it's essential for saving the planet.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: Alexander, can you tell us about the role of industrial hemp in ESG and sustainability efforts?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA: As a plant-based material, industrial hemp has a lower environmental impact than many traditional materials such as cotton or synthetic fibers. Additionally, hemp requires less water, fertilizer, and pesticides to grow than other crops and has a shorter growth cycle. The fibrous stalk of the industrial hemp variety can be used for many industrial applications, including building materials, textiles, and bioplastics, which can help reduce waste and carbon emissions in various industries. Industrial hemp can even be used to create biodegradable plastics, which can help reduce plastic pollution in oceans and landfills. One of the most remarkable benefits of industrial hemp is its ability to remediate soil contaminated with heavy metals, glyphosate, pfas, and pfoas. This crop can help pull the bad out of the soil while contributing to the good and is a simple solution that checks a lot of boxes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: How can industrial hemp be used as an alternative to deforestation?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA: With a fast-growing season, industrial hemp can provide an alternative to cutting down trees and significantly reduce the pressure on our forests. The fiber from industrial hemp is strong and can be used to make sustainable and eco-friendly building materials such as hempcrete, which can lower carbon footprint compared to traditional concrete. Industrial hemp can also be used to make paper, which can help reduce the number of trees that are cut down.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: How do you see the future of industrial hemp and ESG?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA: Industrial hemp has the potential to be a game-changer in ESG and sustainability efforts. By creating jobs, and manufacturing green sustainable building materials, textiles, and bioplastics, we can benefit both the community and the environment. Industrial hemp can also be used for phytoremediation, which is the process of using plants to remove pollutants from soil and water. By utilizing industrial hemp, we can reduce waste, lower carbon emissions, and preserve our environment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: Can you talk about your partnership with Smart Ledger and Pure Shenandoah?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA: Smart Ledger and Pure Shenandoah are providing the industrial hemp fiber fields for our hemp carbon project. We are excited to partner with them and utilize industrial hemp to reduce carbon emissions and promote sustainability efforts.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: How does the hemp carbon project utilize blockchain technology?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA: The hemp carbon project uses blockchain technology to issue smart contracts for carbon offsets. By flying drones over the area, we count the trees and issue contracts on the BSV blockchain for the permanence of the forest. The offsets are tied back to the original smart contract and drone scan, ensuring authenticity and preventing fraud. We can also use blockchain technology to ensure that the benefits of industrial hemp are realized and that we are making a positive impact on our world.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: What are your plans for the future of the hemp carbon project?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA: By next year, our goal is to roll out the hemp carbon project and open it up to forestry projects and initiatives as well as general farm initiatives issuing offsets on common cash crops like corn and soy. We hope to expand the platform and work towards a more sustainable future.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/2023/05/The-Author--2-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" srcset=\"https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/05/The-Author--2-.png 600w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/05/The-Author--2-.png 1000w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2023/05/The-Author--2-.png 1600w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/2023/05/The-Author--2-.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e",

She primarily focuses on private equity and lending to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and works for Finance Contact, a firm with a mandate from the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs to co-finance startups in emerging economies via the SECO Startup Fund (SSF). The SSF provides long-term loans to establish private companies in emerging economies and create quality jobs, as well as to demonstrate how businesses can be run in a socially and ecologically responsible manner.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eChallenges Faced by Women Entrepreneurs\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWomen entrepreneurs face various challenges in emerging markets, including balancing their family responsibilities with their business ventures and lack of confidence. The legal system in many countries also prevents women from inheriting or owning land, making it challenging to provide collateral. Building a successful business necessitates resilience and the ability to adapt to changes and challenges.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAccording to Susanne, women are often neglected in business opportunities because men possess the \"I can do attitude,\" which gives them a natural advantage. In contrast, women must work harder to develop this attitude, making it challenging to compete in the business world. Additionally, the financial system is biased against women, who are perceived as having less confidence and are less capable than men. This perception is reinforced by the legal system in many countries, where women are prohibited from inheriting or owning land, making it difficult to obtain collateral for loans.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo address these issues, Susanne believes that women require more support and relief from specific responsibilities to succeed in business. Women often prioritize their family duties over their business ventures, but with more support, they can achieve success in both areas. Education plays a critical role in changing perceptions of women's roles in society, emphasizing that raising a child and making a home is the responsibility of both parents, not just the mother's.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eImportance of Women's Empowerment\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEmpowering women entrepreneurs has a positive development effect on the wider community and country, according to research. However, women entrepreneurs receive only a small fraction of funding in impact investor space, public development cooperation, and private development cooperation. Women entrepreneurs require a conducive environment to thrive and grow their businesses, necessitating the government and financial institutions' involvement in creating such an environment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAccess to finance and training and mentorship programs are two ways to empower women entrepreneurs. Women entrepreneurs have limited access to finance due to collateral requirements, lack of financial literacy, and discriminatory practices by financial institutions. Governments and financial institutions can make financial services more accessible to women entrepreneurs by offering low-interest loans, credit lines, and other forms of financial support. Training and mentorship programs can help women entrepreneurs acquire the skills and knowledge they need to start and grow their businesses.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSusanne's interview provides valuable insights into the struggles of women in business, the importance of resilience in building a successful business, and the factors to consider in impact investment. As we strive for gender equality in business, it is critical to recognize and address these challenges.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ewatch the full interview \u003ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/events/susannegrossmann-loveandcompass7042867256447430656/comments/?ref=monetix-lending.ghost.io\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

It affects all parts of the world, and Africa is no exception. Leonard Ozoemena, chairman of the Global Environmental Consortium for Africa (GECAF), is a strong advocate for environmental preservation, particularly in Africa. In this blog post, we will discuss the urgency of environmental preservation and why it is crucial for the survival of humanity. more of the detailed conversations on our webcast \u003ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/events/howtobuildenvironmentalsustaina7048937267385561088/comments/?ref=monetix-lending.ghost.io\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe environment is not just a geographical or racial issue, but a human issue. The impact of climate change affects us all, regardless of where we live or what our background is. While Africa contributes less than 5% of the damage caused by environmental harm, the continent bears the brunt of climate change due to a lack of infrastructure, early warning systems, and education. This is why Leonard Ozoemena, owner of Compass Solutions LLC and chairman of the Global Environmental Consortium for Africa, is a passionate advocate for the environment.\u003cbr\u003eIn a recent conversation, Ozoemena emphasized the urgent need for environmental action, particularly in Africa. The conversation highlighted three key topics: the urgent need for global cooperation, the importance of government policies, and the role of individual action.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\"We need to recognize that the environment is not a singular issue, but a collective issue that affects us all. It is time to work together to find solutions that are sustainable and effective. We owe it to ourselves and to future generations to act now and take responsibility for our planet.\"\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Urgent Need for Global Cooperation\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOzoemena stressed the need for global cooperation to mitigate the negative impact of climate change. He argued that we need to work together to stop the damage that has been done and begin to reverse what is reversible and adapt to what is adaptive. Only then can we preserve the world we leave for future generations? This is a call to action for all of us. We need to recognize that the environment is not a singular issue, but a collective issue that affects us all.\u003cbr\u003eFor global cooperation to be successful, we need to break down barriers and work together. This means that we need to engage in dialogue with people from different cultures and backgrounds. We need to learn from each other and work together to find solutions. This is particularly important in Africa, where the impact of climate change is disproportionately felt. We need to support African communities and work together to find solutions that are sustainable and effective.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Importance of Government Policies\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOzoemena also highlighted the crucial role of government policies in addressing environmental issues. He emphasized the need for governments to legislate and direct people on a macro level. If governments take responsibility for setting the agenda and incorporating a healthy respect for the environment, individuals will act accordingly.\u003cbr\u003eThe government has a crucial role to play in setting the tone and providing the resources needed to address environmental issues. Ozoemena argued that policies must change through advocacy and that the power of a great idea can conquer all. He urged people to mobilize and challenge organizations and institutions that are designed to serve us, such as the fashion industry and financial institutions. We must hold these institutions accountable and demand that they invest in environmentally responsible practices.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Role of Individual Action\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile government policies play a crucial role in addressing environmental issues, Ozoemena also stressed the importance of individual action. He argued that everyone has a responsibility to act and that every action counts. We need to incorporate a healthy respect for the environment into our daily lives, from the primary level to the tertiary level.\u003cbr\u003eEducation is key, and both formal and informal education must incorporate environmental sensitivity and awareness. Ozoemena noted that people often don't care about the environment because the government and social contract do not include caring. If we rewrite the social contract to include caring for the environment, people will act accordingly. We need to make sure that every individual feels empowered to take action and make a difference.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLeonard Ozoemena's conversation highlighted the urgent need for environmental action. We need to work together globally to mitigate the negative impact of climate change and preserve the world we leave for future generations. Government policies play a crucial role in addressing environmental issues, but individual action is also important. We need to incorporate a healthy respect for the environment into our daily lives and demand that organizations and institutions invest in environmentally responsible practices.\u003cbr\u003eThe power of a great idea can conquer all, and we must mobilize and challenge those who do not prioritize the environment.

However, a new investment approach has emerged in recent years, which not only generates financial returns but also creates positive social and environmental impacts. This approach is called impact investing and is gaining popularity in Africa.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eImpact investing is a trend in the investment world that seeks to generate both financial returns and positive social or environmental impact. Although the concept of impact investing is not new, it has gained traction as investors seek to align their investments with their values and make a difference in the world.

By investing in countries such as Uganda, where the development level is still low, there are abundant opportunities for growth and success. Prinz highlights the importance of demographics, resources, and untapped talent in Africa, making it an attractive investment destination. He also emphasizes that impact investment in Africa can not only generate financial returns but also create meaningful social and environmental impact, making a positive difference in the lives of others.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eImpact investing has the potential to address some of the limitations of traditional aid and philanthropy in Africa. While aid and philanthropy have played a critical role in addressing social and environmental challenges, they often fail to create sustainable solutions.

Historically, women have been underrepresented in finance and investment, but recent years have seen a positive shift, with more and more women breaking through barriers to make an impact in the field of impact investing. Impact investing seeks to generate both a financial return and positive social and environmental impact.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAccording to a report by the Global Impact Investing Network (GIIN), women are leading the way in driving growth in the impact investing sector. The report found that women are more likely than men to recognize the importance of investing for impact and to invest in companies that prioritize social and environmental outcomes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAudrey Choi, Chief Marketing Officer and Chief Sustainability Officer at Morgan Stanley, is a prominent example of a woman making a significant impact in impact investing. Choi has been a leading voice in promoting sustainable investing and has played a key role in Morgan Stanley's efforts to channel capital towards sustainable investments.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJacqueline Novogratz, Founder and CEO of Acumen, is another influential woman making an impact in impact investing. Acumen is a non-profit organization that uses impact investing to support social enterprises that address poverty and other social challenges. Novogratz is recognized as a leading voice in the impact investing space and has written extensively about the need for a more inclusive and sustainable approach to capitalism.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWomen are also making an impact in impact investing through their leadership of impact investment firms. For instance, Jennifer Pryce is the President and CEO of Calvert Impact Capital, a prominent impact investment firm. Pryce has been a vocal advocate for impact investing and has worked to increase the accessibility of impact investments to a broader range of investors.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWomen are making an impact in impact investing through their work as impact investors themselves. Abigail Noble, CEO of The ImPact, a membership network of families committed to making impact investments, is an exemplar. Noble has been a vocal advocate for the role of families in driving impact investing and has worked to develop strategies for families to align their investments with their values.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother notable woman making an impact in impact investing is MacKenzie Scott, the philanthropist, and author. Scott has made headlines for her significant donations to a variety of nonprofit organizations focused on social and environmental impact. In her philanthropic work, Scott has emphasized the importance of investing in organizations led by people from historically marginalized communities, including women, people of color, and LGBTQ+ individuals.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMore women are playing a significant role in the field of impact investing, from leading impact investment firms to investing directly in impact-oriented companies. As more and more women enter the field of finance and investment, we can expect to see even more progress towards a more sustainable and inclusive form of capitalism. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://investor.monetix.io/investor-signup?ref=monetix-lending.ghost.io\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\"\u003eCTA button Start Impact Investing today.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/2023/03/MONETIX-IG--28--1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1080\" height=\"1080\" srcset=\"https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/03/MONETIX-IG--28--1.png 600w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/03/MONETIX-IG--28--1.png 1000w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/2023/03/MONETIX-IG--28--1.png 1080w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e",

Impact investment provides a way for investors to address these challenges and support companies that are working towards a more sustainable and equitable future.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMeasuring Impact is Challenging\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eImpact investment has also taught us that measuring impact is challenging. It can be difficult to quantify the social and environmental benefits of an investment. Investors need to work with companies to establish clear metrics for measuring impact and regularly evaluate progress toward achieving these metrics.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis lesson highlights the importance of collaboration between investors and companies to ensure that impact is being measured accurately and consistently. It also emphasizes the need for transparency and accountability in reporting impact data.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCollaboration is Crucial\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eImpact investment has demonstrated that collaboration between investors, companies, and other stakeholders is crucial. By working together, investors can leverage their resources to create positive change and achieve shared goals.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis lesson emphasizes the importance of building strong partnerships and networks to achieve impact at scale. Collaboration can help investors identify new opportunities, share knowledge and resources, and build stronger relationships with the communities they serve. We have partnered with local Companies like Capital Savvy | Yo Uganda that know the people and culture of the communities we invest in which has become beneficial in understanding investment dynamics.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatience is Required\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eImpact investment has also shown us that patience is required when investing for impact. Achieving social and environmental effects takes time, and investors need to be patient and committed to the long-term goals of their investments.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis lesson highlights the importance of taking a long-term view when investing for impact. It also emphasizes the need for investors to be patient and resilient in the face of challenges and setbacks. Impact investors must be willing to take the time to listen, observe, and engage with their investees to gain a deeper understanding of their cultural perspectives and contexts. This can involve building relationships with local communities, hiring local staff or advisors, and being open to feedback and constructive criticism.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFinancial Returns Can Still be Achieved\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eImpact investment has shown us that financial returns can still be achieved while making a positive impact. Many impact investments have demonstrated that companies that prioritize social and environmental effects can also be profitable and financially sustainable.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis lesson highlights the potential for impact investment to deliver both financial returns and social and environmental impact. It also emphasizes the need for investors to consider a wide range of investment opportunities that align with their values and objectives.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eImpact investment has taught us several important lessons that can help shape a better future for all of us. By prioritizing social and environmental impact, measuring impact accurately, collaborating effectively, being patient, and seeking financial returns, impact investors can drive positive change and create a more sustainable and equitable world.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://investor.monetix.io/investor-signup?ref=monetix-lending.ghost.io\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\"\u003eCTA button Start Impact Investing today.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/2023/02/MONETIX-IG--27-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1080\" height=\"1080\" srcset=\"https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/02/MONETIX-IG--27-.png 600w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/02/MONETIX-IG--27-.png 1000w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/2023/02/MONETIX-IG--27-.png 1080w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e",

Through entrepreneurship, advocacy, and education, African youth are contributing to sustainable development and economic growth, while also demanding accountability from governments and businesses.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEntrepreneurship is one area where young people in Africa are making a significant impact on SDG 8, which aims to promote sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all. Many young entrepreneurs across the continent are starting new businesses that create jobs and drive innovation. For example, flutter wave, an online payment infrastructure for global merchants and payment service providers across the continent by Nigerian youth, is transforming e-commerce. Meanwhile, Solar Freeze, a Kenyan startup, is using solar energy to power refrigeration units, helping farmers to preserve their crops and reduce waste.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAdvocacy and activism are other areas where the youth in Africa are driving progress on ESG factors. Young people across the continent are using their voices to demand accountability from governments and companies on issues such as climate change, human rights, and corruption. The African Climate Alliance, a youth-led organization in South Africa, is fighting for climate justice and advocating for more ambitious climate policies. In Nigeria, the EndSARS protests mobilized millions of young people to demand an end to police brutality and systemic corruption.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEducation and skills development are also areas where young people in Africa are driving progress on SDGs and ESG factors. Across the continent, programs are providing vocational training and mentorship to young people, helping them to develop the skills they need to succeed in the job market. For example, the Code Queens initiative in Uganda is training young women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, while the Skills Hub in Ghana is providing vocational training and mentorship.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe youth in Africa are demonstrating that they have the creativity, skills, and passion to drive progress on SDGs and ESG factors. By supporting and empowering young people, governments and businesses can unlock their potential and accelerate progress towards a more sustainable and equitable future for all. African youth are proving that they can be leaders and change-makers, and their contributions will be essential in achieving the SDGs and creating a more just and sustainable world.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/2023/02/The-Author.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" srcset=\"https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/02/The-Author.png 600w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/02/The-Author.png 1000w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2023/02/The-Author.png 1600w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/2023/02/The-Author.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e",

While Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investing has been a popular approach, a new impact frontier is emerging that goes beyond ESG and focuses on specific, measurable outcomes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAccording to a recent article from \u003ca href=\"https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/a-new-impact-frontier-beyond-esg-in-2023?ref=monetix-lending.ghost.io\"\u003eNasdaq\u003c/a\u003e, the new impact frontier is a response to the limitations of ESG investing. Critics of ESG investing argue that the criteria are too broad and often don't lead to real-world impact. By focusing on specific outcomes, such as affordable housing, renewable energy, or access to education, investors can have a more direct and tangible impact on the issues they care about.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, choosing between impact and financial return is a complex decision that requires careful consideration.

Some may prioritize financial returns and be willing to accept lower impact, while others may prioritize impact and be willing to accept lower financial returns. In either case, it's crucial for investors to thoroughly research and understand the investment opportunities available to them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe new impact frontier beyond ESG represents a unique opportunity for investors to have a more direct and tangible impact on the issues they care about. However, it's important to understand that this type of investing requires careful consideration and a clear understanding of the trade-offs between impact and financial return.

Since its launch in Kenya in 2007, mobile money has grown exponentially, with 23 million mobile money users in the country and 12.5 million active users as of 2019. The success of mobile money has spread across East Africa, and all countries in the region now have numerous mobile financial platforms that offer much more than just cash transfers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAdditionally, mobile money has enabled small businesses to accept digital payments, facilitating regional trade and commerce.

These services provide a low-cost alternative to traditional financial services, making it easier and more affordable for people to access banking and other financial services. Additionally, mobile money has enabled individuals to send and receive money more quickly and securely, reducing the cost and risk of money transfers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinancial technology also deepens the financial sector in developing economies, providing new instruments and opportunities for businesses and organizations.

These foundations and organizations are supported by both international and local donors, including individuals and corporations, who are looking to make a difference in their communities. The legal framework governing nonprofit organizations in Uganda is also encouraging the growth of philanthropy, as the rules and regulations allow for more flexibility and freedom of action.

The EAPN in partnership with the Independent Development Fund (IDF), DENIVA and GoBig Hub facilitated the establishment of the Uganda National Philanthropy Forum whose objectives are to share best practices, enhance the operating environment for philanthropy in Uganda, and also to generate knowledge on philanthropy practices in Uganda.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are several different types of philanthropy that are being practiced in Uganda, including direct giving, grant-making, and social investment. Direct giving is where donors provide funds directly to the organizations they wish to support, while grant-making allows donors to provide funds to organizations through a competitive process. Social investment is a form of philanthropy where donors provide funds for projects and initiatives that have a social purpose and will benefit the community.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUgandan grantees also shared testimonies of their lived experiences during COVID-19 for the Disability Rights Monitor, a short-term human rights monitoring group focused on the consequences of the pandemic on persons with disabilities globally. This type of philanthropy is particularly important, as it allows for the voices of marginalized persons to be heard and their needs to be addressed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe growth of philanthropy in Uganda has been encouraging, and more needs to be done to ensure that it continues to be a sustainable and effective form of development. This includes creating more opportunities for local foundations and organizations to access funds, as well as increasing awareness and support for philanthropy in Uganda. Additionally, there should be more focus on the intersectional aspects of philanthropy, such as the importance of including persons with disabilities and marginalized groups in the decision-making and implementation process. With the right support and commitment, philanthropy can be a powerful tool for creating positive change in Uganda.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e========================\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://monetix.io/?ref=monetix-lending.ghost.io\"\u003eMonetix.io\u003c/a\u003e - 🚀🇨🇭 A Swiss Company providing Technology \u0026amp; Impact Investing in #Africa🌍🌱ESG focused on priority SDGs of the United Nations:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e1- No Poverty 5 - Gender Equality 6 - Clean Water \u0026amp; Sanitation 8 - Decent Work \u0026amp; Economic Growth 9 - Industry, Innovation \u0026amp; Infrastructure 10 - Reduced Inequalities\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e🌐 For more details - \u003ca href=\"http://www.monetix.io/?ref=monetix-lending.ghost.io\"\u003ewww.monetix.io\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e📩 Write to us to learn how to participate \u003ca href=\"http://mailto:contact@monetix.io/?ref=monetix-lending.ghost.io\"\u003econtact@monetix.io\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e========================\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e💡 Follow us for more:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eImpact Investing, East Africa Opportunity, Investment in Africa, East Africa, How to invest in East Africa, How to invest in Uganda, Uganda Economy, Uganda market, the best way to invest in Africa, Monetix platform, Monetix and CapitalSavvy Partnership, Uganda Businesses, how to do business in Uganda, Uganda business opportunity, Uganda investment opportunity, Education in East Africa, Education in Uganda, Women Empowerment, Women and children of Africa.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/cresbabiera/?ref=monetix-lending.ghost.io\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/2023/02/The-Author--1--6.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" srcset=\"https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/02/The-Author--1--6.png 600w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/02/The-Author--1--6.png 1000w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2023/02/The-Author--1--6.png 1600w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/2023/02/The-Author--1--6.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e",

In 2015, the metropolitan area of Kampala generated an estimated nominal GDP of $13.8 billion (in constant 2011 US dollars), which accounted for more than half of Uganda's GDP that year. This highlights the importance of Kampala to the economy of Uganda. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the heart of Kampala, one can find a diverse mix of business owners from various nationalities, including Chinese, Indians, and locals. This diversity promotes a thriving business ecosystem, as different groups trade and supply each other. The city is home to a variety of shops, selling a range of products such as ready-to-wear clothing, apparel, shoes, gadgets, computers, linens, and other supplies. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe foot traffic and liquidity in downtown Kampala are high, with mobile money allowing businesses to deposit their earnings directly into their accounts, reducing the risk of robbery and ensuring that revenue is secure. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDowntown is where many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are located. As trading activity picked up and restrictions began to ease after the COVID-19 pandemic, neighboring countries such as Ghana, Congo, and Kenya came to Kampala to purchase supplies.

From a young age, he set his sights on becoming who he is today. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne particularly inspiring story from his life is the Bakery Project, which was sparked by the Covid-19 lockdowns. Andrew wanted to find a way to help his community to earn some additional income as well as, minimize the cost of living in the countryside, and give back to the region. He hoped that the success of the project would someday draw the attention of leaders and bring infrastructure improvements such as electricity, water, and roads to the area. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo get the project off the ground, Andrew built a wood-fired oven in his kitchen and began baking small loaves of bread using his own special mix. The loaves were small so that they would be affordable for everyone. He enlisted the help of Boda-Boda drivers (motorbike taxis) to deliver the bread and earn a commission. Andrew quickly realized that there was a great need for the product and service, especially since the lockdowns had disproportionately affected Boda-Boda drivers, who are a vital transportation option in Uganda with over 30,000 operating in the country. As the project gained traction, Andrew designed a bread mixer using a Chinese diesel engine and a crank.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLast year, the bakery generated over $200,000 in sales with a small margin, which was reinvested locally, and the bakery expansion is ongoing with the goal of achieving national certification. Andrew's bakery has now become a hub for local leaders as a successful pilot project, and he has been the reason for planning new roads for the area. Electricity and water are expected to arrive later this year. In addition to the infrastructure improvements and developments, Andrew uses the profits from the bakery to provide scholarships to local students. Monetix is grateful to work with visionary leaders like Andrew and learn about local market knowledge and business customs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"kg-gallery-container\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"kg-gallery-row\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"kg-gallery-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/2022/12/IMG_3649.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" loading=\"lazy\" alt srcset=\"https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2022/12/IMG_3649.jpg 600w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2022/12/IMG_3649.jpg 1000w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2022/12/IMG_3649.jpg 1600w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w2400/2022/12/IMG_3649.jpg 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"kg-gallery-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/2022/12/IMG_3646.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" loading=\"lazy\" alt srcset=\"https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2022/12/IMG_3646.jpg 600w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2022/12/IMG_3646.jpg 1000w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2022/12/IMG_3646.jpg 1600w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w2400/2022/12/IMG_3646.jpg 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"kg-gallery-row\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"kg-gallery-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/2022/12/IMG_3622--1--1.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" loading=\"lazy\" alt srcset=\"https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2022/12/IMG_3622--1--1.jpg 600w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2022/12/IMG_3622--1--1.jpg 1000w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2022/12/IMG_3622--1--1.jpg 1600w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w2400/2022/12/IMG_3622--1--1.jpg 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"kg-gallery-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/2022/12/IMG_3589.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" loading=\"lazy\" alt srcset=\"https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2022/12/IMG_3589.jpg 600w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2022/12/IMG_3589.jpg 1000w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2022/12/IMG_3589.jpg 1600w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w2400/2022/12/IMG_3589.jpg 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e",

In his professional past, he worked for top IT security companies in the US for many years. Initially, Patrick wanted to set up an outsourcing company to attract global customers at lower prices. However, he quickly realized that there was also significant unexplored potential for cybersecurity needs in Uganda. Today, despite its still small size of 15 employees, Applied Principles is the leading Information security and forensics firm in Uganda, setting a new standard regarding the quality of IT security monitoring. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe office compound itself is very well-secured and constantly video-monitored. It seems logical since Applied Principles look after systemically essential organizations such as the Ugandan Central Bank. The company also leverages industry expertise, practices, and tools to deliver transformational and sustainable security and forensics solutions that impact business imperatives. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter Airtel - the most prominent local mobile money provider - was hacked in late 2022 and suffered severe losses, Applied Principles won a large mandate with MTN, another leading mobile money provider. To complete this mandate, Applied Principles must purchase additional equipment, expand its team, and bridge wages until the first tranche of the contract is paid out (which can take up to 6 months). \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJohn Patrick is a demonstration of what the Monetix team experiences over and over again: Uganda's talent is skilled but underfunded. The scarcest input factor is capital. Monetix is making a difference by allowing amazing businesses such as Applied Principles to become African success stories luring in more foreign direct investor capital. John Patrick's goal is to expand the scope of his business as a pan–African Cyber Security, Digital Forensics, and Innovations firm. He is eyeing to employ and build local developers and talents in the country to join his journey.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"kg-gallery-container\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"kg-gallery-row\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"kg-gallery-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/2022/12/IMG_3703.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" loading=\"lazy\" alt srcset=\"https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2022/12/IMG_3703.jpg 600w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2022/12/IMG_3703.jpg 1000w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2022/12/IMG_3703.jpg 1600w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w2400/2022/12/IMG_3703.jpg 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"kg-gallery-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/2022/12/IMG_3701.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" loading=\"lazy\" alt srcset=\"https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2022/12/IMG_3701.jpg 600w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2022/12/IMG_3701.jpg 1000w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2022/12/IMG_3701.jpg 1600w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w2400/2022/12/IMG_3701.jpg 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"kg-gallery-row\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"kg-gallery-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/2022/12/IMG_3689.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" loading=\"lazy\" alt srcset=\"https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2022/12/IMG_3689.jpg 600w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2022/12/IMG_3689.jpg 1000w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2022/12/IMG_3689.jpg 1600w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w2400/2022/12/IMG_3689.jpg 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"kg-gallery-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/2022/12/IMG_3687.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" loading=\"lazy\" alt srcset=\"https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2022/12/IMG_3687.jpg 600w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2022/12/IMG_3687.jpg 1000w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2022/12/IMG_3687.jpg 1600w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w2400/2022/12/IMG_3687.jpg 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e",

It serves many well-known companies in Uganda, including Centenary Bank, the country’s second-largest bank. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLike any other business, Aisha faced a tremendous impact on revenue during the strict COVID-19 lockdowns. As a result, the company had to let go of more than half of its employees to survive the pandemic. Typically, for each large order, Aisha would travel to China to inspect production and the goods before they are loaded into containers and shipped to Uganda. Due to the introduced corona measures, however, she could not go to China in 2020 and 2021 and had to rely on the producers in Shenzhen. Aisha ordered clothes for the entire Stanbic Uganda workforce. What happened next is a young entrepreneur’s nightmare: Two large containers with clothing all in children's sizes arrived. It was a full write-off and almost brought the business down to its knees. Still, with her perseverance, faith, and financial assistance from our local partner in Uganda she managed a come-back. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrom simple designing, layouts, t-shirt printing, souvenirs, and company signages, to very large orders of employee uniforms with logo embroideries, Unique Solutions has the workforce and experience to deliver all orders on time. Serving nationwide demand, Aisha requires working capital funding to complete her orders as she is still coping with the losses from the pandemic.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"kg-gallery-container\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"kg-gallery-row\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"kg-gallery-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/2022/12/IMG_4306.JPG\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" loading=\"lazy\" alt srcset=\"https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2022/12/IMG_4306.JPG 600w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2022/12/IMG_4306.JPG 1000w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2022/12/IMG_4306.JPG 1600w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w2400/2022/12/IMG_4306.JPG 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"kg-gallery-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/2022/12/IMG_4309.JPG\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" loading=\"lazy\" alt srcset=\"https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2022/12/IMG_4309.JPG 600w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2022/12/IMG_4309.JPG 1000w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2022/12/IMG_4309.JPG 1600w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w2400/2022/12/IMG_4309.JPG 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"kg-gallery-row\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"kg-gallery-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/2022/12/IMG_3230-1.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" loading=\"lazy\" alt srcset=\"https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2022/12/IMG_3230-1.jpg 600w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2022/12/IMG_3230-1.jpg 1000w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2022/12/IMG_3230-1.jpg 1600w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w2400/2022/12/IMG_3230-1.jpg 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"kg-gallery-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/2022/12/IMG_3234-2.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" loading=\"lazy\" alt srcset=\"https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2022/12/IMG_3234-2.jpg 600w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2022/12/IMG_3234-2.jpg 1000w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2022/12/IMG_3234-2.jpg 1600w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w2400/2022/12/IMG_3234-2.jpg 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e",

A few years ago, he started buying onions and other vegetables from farmers in the country. Initially in minimal amounts (a sack of onions). He, in turn, sold the products in the city's market. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnce, when buying onions, he discovered a coffee plant. He was fascinated and wanted to learn all about it. His father, who lives in the countryside,  offered him permission to use part of his land to learn about the production of coffee beans. Once he understood the entire production cycle including trading and shipping, he decided to go into coffee trading himself. At first, nobody wanted to give him credit. After thorough due diligence and the necessary guarantees, Sylvester received funding from Monetix’s local partner to buy coffee beans from the cooperatives. He started with USD 100 and today it generates just shy of USD 2.5m in sales and is growing strongly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e Seth \u0026amp; Cushman trade Arabica and Robusta coffee. Its customers are international wholesalers who roast the raw beans. Seth \u0026amp; Cushman Market Traders Ltd. helps the growth of the coffee exporting industry in Uganda. Monetix’s local partner supports Sylvester with additional funding as he expands the current project. Beyond coffee trading, Seth \u0026amp; Cushman provide local farmers with the proper farming equipment to support efficient production. Through Sylvester’s engagement, his firm is seen positively by the local farmers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"kg-gallery-container\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"kg-gallery-row\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"kg-gallery-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/2022/12/IMG_4392.JPG\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" loading=\"lazy\" alt srcset=\"https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2022/12/IMG_4392.JPG 600w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2022/12/IMG_4392.JPG 1000w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2022/12/IMG_4392.JPG 1600w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w2400/2022/12/IMG_4392.JPG 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"kg-gallery-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/2022/12/IMG_4391.JPG\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" loading=\"lazy\" alt srcset=\"https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2022/12/IMG_4391.JPG 600w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2022/12/IMG_4391.JPG 1000w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2022/12/IMG_4391.JPG 1600w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w2400/2022/12/IMG_4391.JPG 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"kg-gallery-row\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"kg-gallery-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/2022/12/IMG_4387.JPG\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" loading=\"lazy\" alt srcset=\"https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2022/12/IMG_4387.JPG 600w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2022/12/IMG_4387.JPG 1000w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2022/12/IMG_4387.JPG 1600w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w2400/2022/12/IMG_4387.JPG 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"kg-gallery-image\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/2022/12/IMG_4386.JPG\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" loading=\"lazy\" alt srcset=\"https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2022/12/IMG_4386.JPG 600w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2022/12/IMG_4386.JPG 1000w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2022/12/IMG_4386.JPG 1600w, https://monetix-lending.ghost.io/content/images/size/w2400/2022/12/IMG_4386.JPG 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e",

Ben Owili, the CEO of Business Summit Africa, at that time, was running two campaigns with the European Union (EU) and the Government of Uganda - Ministry of Agriculture. One of these is Mapping Farmers, where they have to go to the public, do interviews, and get their locations and activities.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe second part was the IT development of an Information Management System. They had to switch the concentration of their campaigns from the Mapping farmers and focus on the IT development side. This brilliant move became successful, as this campaign is doable during the pandemic since they cannot go to the public.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe pandemic established limited access to the business' maximum potential. This made an impact on every company in the region.

They started the company in 2013.  Interacted with other aggregated farmers and created a good working relationship and a binding working structure. This harmonious workforce gave opportunities to the youth and women in the community.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSeth \u0026amp; Cushman Market Traders Ltd. used to go to companies involved with the farmers on the ground. They coordinate and tell them they have farmers who can also supply the coffee. They prepare the coffee to their required standard and deliver it on time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSylvester shared how delicate they choose the coffee beans and the procedure they do to achieve high-quality coffee. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote class=\"kg-blockquote-alt\"\u003e\"The farmer goes to the garden, picks the red cherry of this coffee, and brings it to us. We do the hand-picking of the underripe, the overripe coffee, and the green cherries. We eliminate them or we separate them from the extreme red cherry. For the red cherry, we will put it in water and float it over. After floating, it will see that the insect-bitten coffee, which is the defect, will be also eliminated from the fresh red cherries. The fresh red cherries pulp fermented overnight,  to remove the mucilage, wash the coffee, and dry them on certain ranks. \" - Sylvester Kamuli\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis whole process minimizes the defects by about 96%, by fast hand sorting of the bad coffee, and floating the coffee to remove the insect-bitten cherries that will probably give a different aroma.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe demand for orders increased during the time when the company was facing some financial challenges. They have decided to work with Gumutindo Coffee Cooperative Enterprise and Kyagalanyi Coffee Ltd to resolve it. They started in this way to support these companies and give them commissions in return. Then, they branched out with little cash flow and solid experience over time. They did that for about six years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSeth \u0026amp; Cushman Market Traders Ltd. has started to grow and build a bigger network.

There and then CapitalSavvy enters and bridges the financial gaps. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote class=\"kg-blockquote-alt\"\u003e\"For example.

The women's sector in the community includes five permanent and ten temporary staff.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSylvester gave reasons why he sees his company continue doing business with CapitalSavvy for the next 10 years and more.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote class=\"kg-blockquote-alt\"\u003e\"No. 1, There are no finances that are enough. No. 2, CapitalSavvy has created a homely and comfortable environment in my kind of business. – At the end of the day, when CapitalSavvy gives me time to clear my dues, I'm very happy about that, and next time I have the confidence to go back because of the way I was treated earlier.

The innovation is key to the growth of such businesses since it cuts down on traditional banking charges, numerous trips to the bank to make deposits or draw funds. The functionality seen with this unique technology comes to play when customers can interact directly with their mobile phone or through their desktop PC and have easy access to financial services.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSince everything is done online, Monetix encourages customers to upload the necessary documentation such as government IDs and clear passport photos for faster loan appraisal, approval, and final disbursement of funds. This digital solution aligns with the widespread use of mobile money that has swept across Africa in the last ten years.

Together we will be able to provide swift access to affordable capital.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe majority of the African population does not rely on traditional banks.
